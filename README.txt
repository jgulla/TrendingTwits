This is a simple jQTouch app I threw together for a talk I did on the subject.

The back-end server is written in Ruby using Sinatra as a simple web server.  The Twitter APIs were
josen becasue they were simple and don't requre an API key.

If you're interested in jQTouch, I highly reccomend the peepcode.com screencast ($9) on the
subject. It was very helpful to me.

Don't use this as any kind of example of a "best practice" or even so-so practice. It's a quick and
dirty example. Hopefully you will find it useful. I put it under the MIT licence.
